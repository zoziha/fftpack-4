Fortran fftpack API Documentation
================================

This is the main API documentation landing page generated by [FORD].
The documentation for comment markup in source code, running [FORD] and the [FORD project file] are all maintained on the [FORD wiki].

[FORD]: https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford#readme
[FORD wiki]: https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford/wiki
[FORD project file]: https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/blob/master/API-doc-FORD-file.md

Goals and Motivation
====================

The Fortran FFTPACK 4.0, as published by the NETLIB (http://www.netlib.org/), does
not have a good experinece. The goal of this project is to provide a community
driven fft package v4.0 with a modern easy-to-use interface for Fortran, called a
FFT Package (`fftpack`). 

Scope
=====

The goal of the FFTPACK is to achieve the following general scope:

* fftpack easy-to-use interface
* ford-api-doc
* multi-precision fftpack
* benchmarks
